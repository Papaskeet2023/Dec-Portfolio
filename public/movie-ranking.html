<h1>Pete's greatest movies collection</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Forrest Gump</h3>
<p>This is my favourite. It covers so much content and different eras of time. Tom Hanks was a brilliant actor in this role.</p>
<h3>Joe Dirt</h3>
<p>This film was such a great watch because it covered so many different views from different classes of people.</p>
<h3>Waterboy</h3>
<p>I feel this is such a great film because it covers everything from being an underdog, to a mother realizing she has to finally let her son become a man.</p>
