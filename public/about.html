<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Pete Briant. I am a 45 year old man that currently lives in beautiful sunny Florida in the United 
  States. I am currently employed in the swimming pool industry. I build swimming pools and spas along the gulf coast 
  here in Florida. 
</p>

<p>How did I end up in Web Development? Years ago I studied Web Development at the College Of Baker. However due to 
  family circumstances I was unable to finish my program. I messed with different tutorials here and there just to keep 
  my mind sharp. I have now resmed studies here at Udemy and look forward to what this bootcamp has to offer.

</p>

<p>I am hoping to fulfill the curriculum and hone my skills to be able to design and maintain my business website for my
  swimming pool business. A website is the backbone of the advertising aspect of a business. Being able to not only create 
  and maintain my own website to my liking for obvious business reasons, I feel it will also serve ass a sense of achievement.
